# Scrapbookify
This is an interactive, scrapbook style spotify app, built using NextJS. The intention of the app is to show user listening habits in a scrapbook form

The app prompts the user to login using spotify, and once redirected back to the app, allows the user to see their top songs/artists of the last -
- 4 Weeks
- 6 Months
- All time

The app is currently deployed using Vercel, however due to spotifys API rules, only the spotify accounts on the projects whitelist is able to access the app. So non whitelisted users will only be able to see the home page
